W1z4rDV1510n Upgrade Roadmap (ordered)

Tracking: use this list in order; mark items as done when completed.

[x] 1) Scientific signal validity pipeline
    - Sensor-specific quality gates (SNR, jitter, missingness, drift).
    - Robust resampling/detrending for irregular sampling.
    - Integrate quality into source confidence and labeling metadata.
    - Status: complete.

[x] 2) Sub-ultradian -> ultradian multi-resolution extraction
    - Wavelets / multitaper PSD / EMD-HHT where CPU-viable.
    - Cross-frequency coupling to link sub-ultradian motifs to ultradian layers.
    - Status: complete (sub-ultradian band + PAC + PSD + wavelet + multitaper + EMD-lite added).

[x] 3) 3D motion + camera rigor
    - Camera stabilization (metadata + keypoint flow) + multi-person tracking.
    - Stereo depth + multi-view triangulation in spatial estimator.

[x] 4) Minicolumn neurogenesis with inhibitory arbitration
    - Spawn minicolumns from stable phenotype signatures.
    - Sensory mismatch drives inhibition; release back to multineuron detail.

[x] 5) Motif playback + human labeling
    - 3D replay capsules for motif review.
    - Queue and reward workflow for human validation.

[x] 6) Network merge fidelity
    - Versioned motif lineage + provenance.
    - CRDT-style conflict handling and peer-weighted merges.

[ ] 7) Delegated compute scheduler
    - Capacity advertising, task routing, reward alignment.
    - Graceful offload when nodes miss accuracy/efficiency targets.

[ ] 8) Risk + narrative reconstruction
    - Plain-English causal histories with multi-scale zoom.
    - Tie narrative severity to health overlay spectrum.

[ ] 9) Quantum path integration
    - Use quantum APIs for branch scoring where enabled.
    - Feed calibration back into simulator parameters.
